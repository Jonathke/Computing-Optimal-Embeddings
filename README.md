# Computing Orientations from the Endomorphism Ring of Supersingular Curves and Applications

Algorithms for computing Optimal Embeddings, from [update]. The code includes PoC code for Algorithm 1 and 3, for computing embeddings of quadratic orders into quaternion orders. In addition, it also contains Algorithm 4, for computing ideals equivalent to the connecting ideal of two orders of a specific degree (corresponding to computing isogenies of a specific degree).

Run 
```[bash]
sage tests.sage
```

for a demo!
