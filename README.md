# Computing Orientations from the Endomorphism Ring of Supersingular Curves and Applications

Algorithms for computing Optimal Embeddings, from the paper *[Computing Orientations from the Endomorphism Ring of Supersingular Curves and Applications](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/146)*. The code includes PoC code for Algorithm 1 and 3, for computing embeddings of quadratic orders into quaternion orders. In addition, it also contains Algorithm 4, for computing ideals equivalent to the connecting ideal of two orders of a specific degree (corresponding to computing isogenies of a specific degree).

Run 
```[bash]
sage tests.sage
```

for a demo!
